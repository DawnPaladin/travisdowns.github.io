message: "Yes, I am aware of it. In fact, `memset` appears more that 20 times in this post alone and it didn't get there by accident.\r\n\r\n`memset` would be safe to use in this specific case for `char` arrays, but it tough to use safely in general (even for standard layout types in some cases) in C++, so I generally prefer `std::fill` in new code (not to mention std::fill is much more general).\r\n\r\nBTW, `std::memset` is only part of the \"standard C++ library\" by virtue of its more or less wholesale inclusion of the C standard library. So it's technically part of the library but it doesn't play nice with much of the language, in the same way that `malloc` and `free` are technically part of the standard, but could be considered a vestigial appendage from C."
